# How to release

## Use github release system

You can find the link `Create a new release` on the right on this [page](https://github.com/PrestaShopCorp/puik) or you can use directly this [link](https://github.com/PrestaShopCorp/puik/releases/new).

Once you clicked on, you have to create a tag by clicking on `Choose a tag`, write your tag name like `vX.X.X`.

Make sure that `main` is selected as `Target`.

Set the `Release title` as the version of your tag `vX.X.X` and for the description you have to click on `Generate release notes`.

Make sure that `Set as a pre-release` checkbox is checked.

And finally you can smash the `Publish release` button.

One package will be pushed to `npm` and one to `github`.
